# TypeScript Practice Repository

Welcome to the TypeScript Learning Repository! This repository is a place for you to explore and practice TypeScript, a powerful statically typed superset of JavaScript. Whether you're new to TypeScript or looking to enhance your TypeScript skills, you're in the right place.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Typescript-Practice
```

2. Install the project dependencies using PNPM:

```js
pnpm install
```

3. Now, you're all set to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript. Run the following command to generate JavaScript files from TypeScript source files using the TypeScript compiler:

```js
pnpm tsc
```

This will compile the TypeScript files (.ts) in the project and generate the corresponding JavaScript files (.js) in the output directory.

### Project Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the TypeScript source code files. You can write and edit your TypeScript code in this folder.

- `dist/`: This directory contains the compiled JavaScript output files. After running `pnpm tsc`, you'll find the generated JavaScript files in this folder.
